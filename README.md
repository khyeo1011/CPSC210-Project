# Ecosystem Simulator 

This project is going to be a simulator that can describe a very primitive ecosystem
where there are going to be producers, and consumers. It's going to contain some
ways in which the user can control their behavior in ways such as controlling their
aggressiveness, need to reproduce, how easy it is to find food, etc. The reason for
choosing this field is that I have always liked the idea that some traits were
naturally selected to replace traits that it had an advantage on. My goal is to
replicate this idea in a way such that the user can control what is selected, and
maybe have an option to simulate 1000s of variations of the organisms, and what
becomes the mose "successful" variant.
