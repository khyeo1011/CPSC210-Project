# Gamecketlist

This application's purpose is to keep track of all the games that I wish to
play. I want to keep track of the Game's link, necessary equipment (such as a console),
some screenshots, it's price, it's genre. The reason for creating such an 
app is that video games can become pricey, and would get it if the game goes on sale
or decide to buy it in full price. The users of this particular application would
be not only me, but also for people who keep forgetting the games that they want
to play in the near future.
